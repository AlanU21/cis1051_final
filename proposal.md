# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Raspberry Pi Room Temperature & Humidity Reader

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Raspberry Pi that will read the temperature and humidity of a room and text the information to your phone.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The Raspberry Pi will be hooked up to a DHT22 sensor which will read the rooms temperature and humidity ratings using Python commands. Then, using a Python library that can interface with Google Voice, it will send you an SMS message with the readings.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The Raspberry Pi will read the temperature and humidity ratings of the room and print them on its dashboard.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to at least send emails, or have an alert of some kind go off. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

That the Raspberry Pi can send SMS messages to a certain number, a certain number of times a day.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research Raspberry Pi and the temperature sensors and see how I can make them interface with the messaging system. This is a very new topic to me so a lot of research will be required. I must also purchase the necessary tools for this, such as a Raspberry Pi 3, a DHT22 Temperature Sensor, and an SD card.
