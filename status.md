Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have ordered the materials for my project, which included the Raspberry Pi 3, a DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, and an SD card, all of which arrived in the mail today. I also began researching Raspberry Pi and all its functionality to start learning how to implement the code to make the project work.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not assembled the parts yet and I have yet to implement the code itself. However, now that the parts have arrived, I can begin work.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Until today the only problems I've had have been a lack of materials and a lack of time due to my recent Chicago trip. However, no worries, as I think I should still be able to complete my project in time.
